<h2>How do you escape?
    A General Readme to the World's Shortest Walking Sim.</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This is a game revolving around narrative, story structure, and exploration, much in the same way the games like the Stanley Parable tackle meta game narratives.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
There is no real player goals that are present within this game; the most that this game has to offer is the prospect of exploration, and understanding the narrative via outside work in order to solve future problems. If there is a main player goal, however, it would be important to note that it lies in the Title.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
It's sort of a casual, WASD-and-search/explore experience with slight narrative elements.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
No real gameplay, save for some (yet to be implemented) puzzles that will test your knowledge and know how on logic once the puzzles are developed. While the only real puzzle (and probably the easiest) is how do you escape the box, but puzzles aside it's going to be very akin to narrative-styled games before it. Much of the game, if it's going to be developed further, should be focused more on real life player experience and colliding that with the game. However, for now, it's essentially a very short walking simulator where you explore to a small degree.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The central game mechanic is to establish exploration on small scale for the project, before the game gets bigger in terms of puzzles and world building. From here, it's going to be very relient in having the player "think outside the box", and identify the problems that are there via real life calculations.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The one thing that drives the game foward is the method for which the player is supposed to solve the problems. Many of this include breaking down the game to it's base code, to analyze what makes it tick. Furthermore, it's made specifically to be a game that you play in and outside of, regardless as to whether or not you have real work that you need to do.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
    
The main world hub is presented in a dark, lonely city in which the protagonist is trapped in. He has no idea as to how he got there, and he has no real idea as to get out. He knows that, while the world isn't quite complete, that there is a lot of passion put into where he's at, and that, through logic and determination, he can exit out of where he is. The setting is merely a plot device in order to drive the player forward, but not just within the literary context. It's also embedded into the game, and forces the player to think heavily as to what they can do in their own life to help this character.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are Tag; the protagonist of this story and the main character as well. Claustrophobic, aloof, and scared, he finds himself trapped in a situation that he can't get out of when he's encountered with the fact that he cannot proceed to the next room and get back on with his life. However, given that the next room not only leads to nothing, but also leads to the unknown, he must use his inner knowledge to find a way to crack the game itself to escape.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I want to reach young, college age students who are looking to sound smart, but don't yet realize the pretentiousness of this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game should take about twenty minutes for those who aren't computer science majors, and five minutes for those who are. However, since puzzles haven't been implemented yet, the game based solely on exploration could be a good few seconds or so.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There aren't a lot of strategies yet, considering the lack of puzzles, so there are no real strategies yet for beating the game, but once I get enough experience with Phaser and it's animation process, I should be good.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The majority of the assets that I made were made from scratch with the small amount of time I had, but I did use some of the documentation on phaser.io to help me out with the programming, as well as some of the code from the "part9" project from Phaser so as to get a basic understanding as to how to better make my game. I also used Freddie Joachim's "Sauced" from his album "Tiger" for the music you're hearing as you play this game.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Some games that come to mind are point-and-click adventure games, or better yet walking simulators like Dear Ester.
