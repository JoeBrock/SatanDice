<h2>Satan's Dice Roller</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Beat Satan's cultist in a brutal deal to the death.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Essentially, it's a game of Russian Roulette. Your job, as the player, is to get through all the rounds. If you lose, you'll suffer a brain meltdown and die. However, if you're opponent loses, they die and you win. Pretty simple, but if anything I'm planning on adding a few more additions to the game if I have the time and chance to. Be sure to stay tuned for more!
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
It's sort of a casual, luck-based horror-esque experience with slight narrative elements.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Among some of the actions that the player can perform, they can choose to pass, hit or skip turn. If they skip their turn, then that means that they'll have to go and play Russian roulette and will have an increased chance of dying, but if they survive, than that means that their opponent will have to do it twice.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The central game mechanic is really luck and strategizing to get the best possible outcome that could come out of this.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Mostly the time limit, because it allows a sort of struggle between the want to strategize and plan for what the next move will be, versus the amount of time that they have to make that decision.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
    
The main world hub is presented in a dark, mysterious room, possibly away from civilization. It's your typical horror movie atmosphere, but for the majority the player, and in turn the opponent that he's talking to, should not know why they're there or what they are doing over there. The main point though is that, regardless, the opponent very much wants to kill the player, and is willing to go to any lengths in order to do so. If it wasn't for the fact that the devil loves Russian Roulette, though, you probably wouldn't even be here.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The tension of the story collides with the gameplay as it comes from slowly figuring out that the cultist, in a lot of ways, is very much like the player character, in the sense that he very much wants to get out of that situation as best as he can as well. The only difficulty is that the opponent is partially controlled by Satan himself, which can make it difficult considering that you want him to get out. As for you, you don't quite know yourself why you're there either.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I want to reach primarily young, edgy teenagers who are going through the Linkin Park and My Chemical Romance part of their life.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
My game should take about a few minutes currently, but it's dependent on how long the narrative will be in the future.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Just try to survive as long as possible, and if you fail the first time, well, you're kind of dead. You won't be able to retry again until you refresh the browser.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The majority of the assets that I made were made from scratch with the small amount of time I had, but I did use some of the code from the "part9" project so as to get a basic understanding as to how to better make my game.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Possibly the only game that I could possibly think of that's closest to this one is War, in which you're never quite sure who's going to turn up to be the victor.
